## Description:
<hr>
This Website is a Website for a healthcare company. I found that on figma, so I tried to reproduce it : https://www.figma.com/file/EWmzcVkd7qbP5Nf7iMvuqP/Trafalgar-Landing-Page

For this app, I used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React Js

## Why create this app ?
<hr>
As a new and novice front end web developer, I practice my skills everyday. I wanted to test myself so I reproduce this website.
<br>
<br>

## What kind of improvement can you add ?
<hr>
Here's the possible improvement I would like to make:<br>
<br>
- Add some animation to make the UX better
- As you can see on the figma link, there are a few background images, so I want to add it. 
- The app is responsive except for the biggest screen, so I need to add this too.
